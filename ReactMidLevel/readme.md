# React Mid Level

## Scenario: You have to realize a website to list some movies, being able to filter them, and add some to a favorites list. The website must adhere to the designs provided to you by the design team, and must include a notification system.

### Problem: The webapp:

- must use NextJS 13

- must be responsive, but the design team didnâ€™t give you specifications and the deadline is tight, so you have to put it together yourself
    cannot use a UI library/framework (no material UI, chakra and so on)

- expose two pages: one for listing movies (on the root path) where the user can choose their favorites (which should be saved locally), one for listing favorites and
    optionally remove them

- when the user clicks on the favorite icon, a notification must be shown on the page. This notification will automatically disappear after 5 seconds. If the user changes page 
    during this time, the notification should be persisted across navigation.

- the notification system must allow multiple notifications to be shown at the same time
